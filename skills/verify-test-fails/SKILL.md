# Verify tests fail on master

When writing tests for a change (bug fix or new feature), each test MUST fail on master. A test that passes on both master and the feature branch proves nothing — it does not distinguish "code works" from "code was already like that."

- **Bug fix**: test should fail on master (proving the bug exists), pass on your branch
- **New feature**: test should fail on master (feature doesn't exist yet), pass on your branch

Both cases reduce to: **test must fail on master, pass on your branch.**

## Procedure

1. **Write the tests on your branch** as normal.
2. **Before committing**, stash or note the source changes, check out the base (e.g. `master`), apply only the test file and wiring (cabal/Main.hs), and run the tests.
3. **Every test must fail** (crash, wrong result, compile error, or missing export) on master. If a test passes, it does not exercise the change.
4. **Investigate passing tests**: trace the code path with the specific test input. Find where it short-circuits, returns a default, or otherwise avoids the code you changed.
5. **Replace weak inputs** with ones that force execution through the changed code path.
6. Return to your branch, update the tests, and verify they pass with the change.

## Common trap: lazy evaluation short-circuits

In Haskell (and other lazy languages), expressions connected by `<$>`, `<*>`, `>>=`, or `>>` in `Maybe`/`Either`/parser monads short-circuit on failure. If an early step returns `Nothing`/`Left`, later steps containing the changed code are **never evaluated**.

### Example from mysql-haskell

The timestamp parser:
```haskell
LocalTime <$> dateParser bs <*> timeParser (B.unsafeDrop 11 bs)
```

Test input `"abc"`:
- `dateParser "abc"` calls `readDecimal "abc"` which returns `Nothing` (no digits)
- `fmap LocalTime Nothing` = `Nothing`
- `Nothing <*> timeParser (B.unsafeDrop 11 bs)` = `Nothing`
- `B.unsafeDrop 11 bs` is **never forced** — the bug is not exercised

Test input `"2024-01-01"` (10 bytes):
- `dateParser "2024-01-01"` succeeds, returns `Just date`
- `Just (LocalTime date) <*> timeParser (B.unsafeDrop 11 "2024-01-01")`
- `B.unsafeDrop 11` on 10 bytes is UB — the bug IS exercised

### The principle

Choose inputs that make code **succeed past the guarding steps** so execution reaches the changed operation. Inputs that fail early prove the early guard works, not that your change matters.

## Checklist

- [ ] Each test targets a specific changed operation (buggy code or new feature)
- [ ] Test input is designed to reach that operation (not short-circuit before it)
- [ ] Test fails on master (verified by running on base branch)
- [ ] Test passes on feature branch
- [ ] If a test passed on master, investigate why and fix the input
